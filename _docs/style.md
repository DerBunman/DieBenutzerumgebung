# Style

The GTK2/3 and icon theme are based on Numix and can be generated using ooxmox (see below).

The colors are everywhere the same. (If I didn't miss anything.)

# [ooxmox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox)
The GTK2/3 themes and the iconset have been generated using ooxmox.
You can install [ooxmox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox) and it will automaticly pick up the current definitions and give you the possibility to change the theme to your liking.
